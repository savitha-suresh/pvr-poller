This is a simple python script to keep polling the pvr site to check if the tickets for the desired film is open on the desired date. Once the tickets are opened, you will get a whatsapp message. 

I have used pywhatkit library to send messages to your whatsapp number.

You can change the date and the movie id in script and set your number as env variable and get messages.

For now getting notifications from movie name is not available.
